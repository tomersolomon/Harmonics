## Basic Harominc Analysis
## Tomer Solomon 

I was interested in seeing how reducing the sampling of a sin curve would effect higher harmonics, which was inspired by my digital music class. As such, I whipped up this quick and very basic analysis. As expected, the smaller the samples, the less information is captured in the higher harmonics!

Below is a picture with the results:
